# searchLordOfTheRings
A Java program which reads a text file (A novel) and uses linear, binary and HashSet to search for specific words and it's occurrences. Also compare the time complexity


## Implementation
- First created a class for bookWord object which keeps the count of words and has it's own euals method
- Also created a hashCode function which will generte hash value for the word
- Then read the file and added those words of type bookWord in ArrayList
- Then search for words which are unique in the text file using Linear, Binary and Hashset
- Compare time complexity for all 3 search techniques
